# Udacity-Project - Exploring Gapminder Data

### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 03 - Exploring Gapminder Data using Python

## Description
This project is part of term 1 of the Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity. I decided to
explore [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) data for this project.
Specifically, I will be exploring CO2 emissions per capita and their relation to
time, GDP per capita and population growth rates.

The main goal of this project was to practice and learn new techniques for handling data
using python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
